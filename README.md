# SEISMIC EVENTS ANALYSIS

#Introduction 

The project focuses on the analysis of global seismic events from the midnight of September 1st, 2023 to 9:30am on November 15th, 2023. The goal of this analysis is to perform an analysis on this data and identifying interesting insights
which are highlighted through visualisations. The result of this analysis is then hosted online using a shiny web app. 

The dataset used for this analysis is a real-life dataset gotten from www.ie.com. The analysis started with a data cleaning phase where the data was cleaned. The next step was a deep dive into data analysis and visualization making use of the Plotly library. The last step is the deployement of the visualization of the analysis uisng a shiny for python web application.
